Driver code to interface with a BNO085 sensor IC over an I2C connection.

The firmware is written in C for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

{\itshape Note\+: whilst in active development, this repository will be built as a standard project. Once the code is more substantiated it will be packaged as a library.}
